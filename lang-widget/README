# Lang snippet

The lang-widget is use to display a flag on pages that has multiple
translations. To use it, you need to include this file as a subview in your
template.

In your main view, you can then forge the widget with : 

    <?= \View::forge('my_template::subviews/lang_widget'); ?>

I took the liberty to place the widget in a div id="lang_widget". Do not forget
to add this to your stylesheet.

You should also make sure the flags images are available either by copying
novius-os/static/admin/novius-os/img/flags/ to your template img directory, or
trying to link it directly from the view.
